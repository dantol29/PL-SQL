# PL/SQL
### The 'Hello World' Example
```
DECLARE 
   message  varchar2(20):= 'Hello, World!'; 
BEGIN 
   dbms_output.put_line(message); 
END;
```

### Basic structure
```
DECLARE 
   <declarations section> 
BEGIN 
   <executable command(s)>
EXCEPTION 
   <exception handling> 
END;
```

## Each block consists of three sub-parts

### 1. Declarations (DECLARE)

    This section starts with the keyword DECLARE. 
    It is an optional section and defines all variables, cursors, subprograms, and other elements to be used in the program.

### 2. Executable Commands (BEGIN, END)

    This section is enclosed between the keywords BEGIN and END and it is a mandatory section.
    It consists of the executable PL/SQL statements of the program. 
### 3. Exception Handling (EXCEPTION)

    This section starts with the keyword EXCEPTION. This optional section contains exception(s) that handle errors in the program.

**Every PL/SQL statement ends with a semicolon (;)**

<summary> <h2>Variables</h2> </summary>
   
- `variable_name [CONSTANT] datatype [:= initial_value] `

```
sales number(10, 2); 
pi CONSTANT double precision := 3.1415; 
name varchar2(25); 
address varchar2(100);
```
### SELECT INTO
- The SELECT INTO statement is used to fetch the results of a SQL query and assign them to PL/SQL variables.
- In PL/SQL, the `%TYPE` attribute is used to declare variables with the same data type as a column in a table or a previously declared variable

 <b>Example:</b>
   
```
DECLARE
  v_employee_id  employees.employee_id%TYPE := 101;  -- Variable to hold employee ID
  v_first_name   employees.first_name%TYPE;          -- Variable to hold first name
  v_salary       employees.salary%TYPE;              -- Variable to hold salary
BEGIN
  -- Select first_name and salary into PL/SQL variables
  SELECT first_name, salary
  INTO v_first_name, v_salary
  FROM employees
  WHERE employee_id = v_employee_id;
END;
```
</details>

<details>
<summary> <h2>Arrays</h2> </summary>

### VARRAY
- `varray_type_name IS VARRAY(n) of <element_type>`
- VARRAY can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type
- In Oracle environment, the starting index for varrays is always 1.
- Varrays are one-dimensional arrays.

```
DECLARE 
   type namesarray IS VARRAY(5) OF VARCHAR2(10); 
   type grades IS VARRAY(5) OF INTEGER; 
```

</details>

<details>
<summary> <h2>Loops</h2> </summary>
   
- `EXIT` instead of `RETURN` 
```
DECLARE 
   i number(1); 
   j number(1); 
BEGIN 
   FOR i IN 1..3 LOOP 
      FOR j IN 1..3 LOOP 
         dbms_output.put_line('i is: '|| i || ' and j is: ' || j); 
      END loop inner_loop; 
   END loop outer_loop; 
END; 
```

</details>

<details>
<summary> <h2>Procedures</h2> </summary>
   
- Procedure is a program unit/module that performs a particular task. These subprograms are combined to form larger programs
- A subprogram can be created âˆ’ `At the schema level`, `Inside a package` and `Inside a PL/SQL block`
     1. `At the schema level`, subprogram is a standalone subprogram. It is created with the `CREATE PROCEDURE` or the `CREATE FUNCTION` statement. It is stored in the database and can be deleted with the `DROP PROCEDURE` or `DROP FUNCTION` statement.
     2. `Inside a package`, subprogram is a packaged subprogram. It is stored in the database and can be deleted only when the package is deleted with the `DROP PACKAGE` statement.
     3.  `PL/SQL blocks` that can be invoked with a set of parameters

_How to create a procedure?_
```
CREATE PROCEDURE greetings 
AS 
BEGIN 
   dbms_output.put_line('Hello World!'); 
END; 
```

_How to execute a procedure?_
```
EXECUTE greetings;
```
_OR_
```
BEGIN 
   greetings; 
END; 
```

#### Parameter modes in PL/SQL:

| Type | Value |
| --- | --- |
| IN | lets you pass a value to the subprogram. It is a read-only parameter. Is passed by reference |
| OUT | returns a value to the calling program. Inside the subprogram, an OUT parameter acts like a variable. You can change its value and reference the value after assigning it. The parameter must be variable and is passed by value |	
| IN OUT | passes an initial value to a subprogram and returns an updated value to the caller. It can be assigned a value and the value can be read. Is passed by value |

_An example with `IN` and `OUT`_
```
DECLARE 
   a number; 
   b number; 
   c number;
PROCEDURE findMin(x IN number, y IN number, z OUT number) IS 
BEGIN 
   IF x < y THEN 
      z:= x; 
   ELSE 
      z:= y; 
   END IF; 
END;   
BEGIN 
   a:= 23; 
   b:= 45; 
   findMin(a, b, c); 
   dbms_output.put_line(' Minimum of (23, 45) : ' || c); 
END; 
```

_An example with `IN OUT`_
```
DECLARE 
   a number; 
PROCEDURE squareNum(x IN OUT number) IS 
BEGIN 
  x := x * x; 
END;  
BEGIN 
   a:= 23; 
   squareNum(a); 
   dbms_output.put_line(' Square of (23): ' || a); 
END; 
```

<details>
<summary> <h2>Functions</h2> </summary>
   
**A function is same as a procedure except that it returns a value**

- The function must contain a return statement.
- The `AS` keyword is used instead of the `IS` keyword for creating a standalone function.

_An example with `RETURN` keyword`_
```
DECLARE 
   a number; 
   b number; 
   c number; 
FUNCTION findMax(x IN number, y IN number)  
RETURN number 
IS 
    z number; 
BEGIN 
   IF x > y THEN 
      z:= x; 
   ELSE 
      Z:= y; 
   END IF;  
   RETURN z; 
END; 
BEGIN 
   a:= 23; 
   b:= 45;  
   c := findMax(a, b); 
   dbms_output.put_line(' Maximum of (23,45): ' || c); 
END;
```
